I'm not a talker. And I'm not a midnight joker either. And I'm not joking around when I say that Pittsburgh is the reason I have to carry this albuterol inhaler around. The fact that these males have gone back to polluting our air in the middle of a viral pandemic is beyond unthinkable. I can't begin to tell you how infuriating it is to know these companies are putting our lives at risk just to make a buck. 

We know that air pollution increases the chance of getting COVID-19 and what they're putting into our air, water, and land include many things that we also know to be carcinogenic. The people of this area deserve so much better then this and I personally went to express my disappointment in the ACHD. More can be done.

It is so sad! I grew up here. It breaks my heart. I wanted to spend my days here and now I'm desperately searching for somewhere else to live. I hate it. I don't want to leave and I think this city has potential but that potential is going to be squandered by our shortsighted lack of investment in basic infrastructure and inability to stop shell and US steel from polluting our land, air, and water. It's that simple. And we're getting a reputation. That tech crowd that Pittsburgh has been courting so hard? There's a reason Amazon didn't choose us and there's definitely a reason why Apple doesn't have a greater presence in the region, I can say those two things with personal certainty. Those are just two examples and it's just the beginning. word is getting around and people are not happy about the idea of companies coming to Pittsburgh because of the air. So, ultimately it's going to be good to leave the region because this place is going to tank economically.

Certainly seems like a waste of time. It's not as if you actually do anything that does anything to change what's going on. Slap on the wrist fines are nothing to Shell and US Steel.

1672313978,40.489,-79.9248,5,"h*ll with the lid taken off, aka, Rich Fitzgerald","Much like yesterday and the day before, I am in pain and everything is irritated. This has been happening for days in a row and today is the worst day of all.

I have a horrible headache, both my eyes and nose are irritated and burning, my throat is ripped up and I sound like I spent the night chain-smoking. My lungs physically hurt. My heart rate has been variable all night, bouncing between between dangerously low and tachycardia, which is apparently exactly what happens whenever a person is exposed to this level of VOCs at this amount for this long. I was extremely thirsty throughout the night and that got in the way of sleep, not to mention all of the above occurring overnight (again) getting in the way of my being able to actually get the rest I need to function. I experienced both both insomnia and sleeplessness. When the pollution is this intense and this relentless, I wake up exhausted regardless of how long I have slept. I feel cursed to be stuck in such 
hellish conditions without a way out.

This air here is miserable and is the single biggest reason why I am working so hard to get the tf out of this city. This is going to be the next Cancer Alley, mark my words, and Im not going to be here for it. I have watched far too many people die of bizarre cancers, and neurological disorders. I, too, now have to live with a neurological disorder. There is no doubt in my mind that this ish is the reason why.

So. Pittsburgh doesnt care about me or anyone else. Fine, duck Pittsburgh, and most of all duck Rich Fitzgerald. The amount of interaction is a palling. Not just in this arena, but also in the jail, oversight, board meetings, refusing to meet with constituents, stonewalling people who are looking for answers. The man has wasted his time and all of our money on making himself happy, instead of actually caring about a whole city of people who elected him. Supposedly he works for us, but you would never know it. I want to see that pathetic excuse for a human being man to be sued for not doing his job, and I want him to return every penny that Pittsburgh ever gave him. Thousands if not millions of people are going to die over the years from all the pollution that is not going away anytime soon. Their (and lets be honest, probably my own ) deaths are on his hands. I will feel fortunate if I wake up on my 50th birthday. I dont expect my body will make it that long.","This place is a living h*ll. I have but one goal in my life: leave Pittsburgh forever. It breaks my heart, but there is no choice. I will find a way out of this place because I am not going to die the way I saw so many people I love painfully leave this world. It is appalling to me that more action is not taken. The health department is a joke. I actively encourage people NOT to move to Pittsburgh and if they are here, I encourage them to get the h*ll out. Pittsburgh doesnt deserve our money or time and they certainly dont care about you or your health.",15206

I would bet every penny to my name that in 5 - 10 years we will see even more people dying of cancers, heart problems, and neurological disorders. Rates of conditions like asthma are only going to increase more than they already have. People living here will be substantially more susceptible to getting sick, more so than we already are.

For the love of everything good, I just want to sleep through the night! My head is throbbing as it has been for what? A week now? My eyes are burning and dry. My nose is irritated and hurts. My throat is dry and ripped up despite having drink over a quart of water last night overnight. My lungs feel tight and its difficult to get a breath without having pain. I am deeply nauseated to the point that I dont feel hungry at all anymore. This happens so frequently that I am having trouble eating. My whole body is swollen and sore. I had to draw a picture of what it feels like. I would just draw a picture of the Michelin man engulfed in flames. I am so tired from not havent gotten a quality nights rest yet again. This place is absolutely wrecking me and destroying my health. More than that, its really destroying my life. Not sleeping has impacts on how a person can or cannot function during the day and if you cant eat, youre going to lose weight whether you want to or not, especially when you are constantly enduring nausea. My body is freaking out in so many different ways that the only future that holds any hope for peace for me is as far away from Pittsburgh as possible. That breaks my heart.","Seriously, does anyone read this? If so, why have you not taking any action whatsoever? Clearly slap on the wrist fines are not working. Either do your jobs or step out of the way so that other people can do them. Believe me, people are looking for work, and Im sure they would be happy to actually take action on this issue and be paid to do it. You dont deserve your jobs when you dont do a thing to help protect the people of this area.

This is going to be the next cancer rally and I pray to God that everyone remembers each and every one of the names of the Allegheny health department, Rich Fitzgerald, and anyone else who has any sway over whats occurring right now. May you go down in infamy as the greatest failures  who entirely destroyed what couldve been an amazing city to live in simply by refusing to take action.",15206

Dont let the door hit you, Fitzy, or rather please do. May your karma find you swiftly in this lifetime. And the next. And the next. And","How am I today? Well Ive got the same ol raging headache that will not quit. It isnt physically possible for me to drink enough water to quench my thirst right now. I woke up parched repeatedly throughout the night to drink water throughout the night and slept because of it. 
My eyes were covered in n*sty crust  when I woke up this morning and are both burning as well as watering to the point that it looks like Im crying. My nose acutely burns as if someone has snuffed out matches beneath it all night long. My throat burns, is constantly dry, and is painfully ripped up. My lungs feel like I have torn through a carton of reds overnight. (For the record, your boy does NOT smoke.) I am nauseated to the point that I cant eat right now and cant move much without feeling like Im going to hurl. Overnight my heart rate dipped to 43 bpm (thats really bad) and my blood oxygen dropped to 88% (again, thats REALLY bad) at a time that coincides almost perfectly with the crescendo todays pollution (thus far). I do not have any health issues that involve my heart rate or blood oxygen regularly dropping off a cliff like this. These dips heavily correlate with the poor air quality. Pittsburgh, again, this BS is (not-so) slowly killing me and there is no way I am alone in suffering this way. My heart is going to straight-up stop one of these nights. Ultimately Shell and US Steel need to decide whether quick and dirty profits are really more important than peoples lives. Sadly, it seems that theyve already made that decision. Personally, I dont want to pay the price for their pollution and Richie Fitzs criminal inaction. To say that Rich Fitzgerald has completely failed the people and neglected to do his job is possibly the largest understatement I can think of. It must be something to have a job that pays that WELL for SO little work, neglect your obligations to serve the people for 12 years, and be handed the opportunity to make your already rich friends even wealthier for no reason simply because you can. All this while you sit on your tuchus allowing industries to line your pockets and buy you off so that you will perform no consequential aspect of your job for their benefit at the cost of peoples lives. Few people do less quite as badly as ol Richie boy.",I can now prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that the pollution is destroying my health. What is it gonna take before somebody does something? How bad does it have to get before the health department takes action? How many people have to die before this madness is put to an end?,15206

My nose burns with the same sulphuric stench that has invaded my home. My throat is ripped up, irritated, parched, and sore. There is no amount of water that offers relief. My lungs are sore when I breathe and I had to use my inhaler almost as soon as I woke up coughing and congested. I am incredibly nauseated and have been for quite a while now. Its made it difficult to eat and I seem to be losing both weight and hair. My stomach is an absolute mess. My body is swollen and sore from toe to tip, just as it was yesterday. My heart rate last night bounced between bradycardia and tachycardia. It woke me many times throughout the night and scared the jesus out of me. I am tired of this and it has destroyed my quality of life. The only hope is moving away from this beautiful place that industry has been permitted to destroy for short term profits in exchange for the lives and well being of everyone in this area. The ACHD no longer deserves to call themselves a health department. Fitzy Richgerald is an embarrassment of a public servant and a person.

Id really like to live beyond 50 so Im going to leave the city I love after spending the majority of my life here. Decade after decade, it only gets worse. The cracker plant and the areas insistence on creating dirty steel is no longer some thing that I can tolerate. When Im dying of lung cancer on my deathbed, I will be cursing US Steel and Shell.
